# üß≠ K.A.R.L. Project ‚Äî Schematics (EasyEDA PDF Exports)

This folder contains the **electrical schematics** for the **K.A.R.L. Project**, an autonomous rover powered by a **Raspberry Pi Pico**, **L298N motor driver**, and **MicroPython** control logic.
All diagrams were designed in **EasyEDA** and exported as **.pdf** files for quick viewing and documentation.

---

## üìò Overview

Each schematic captures a core subsystem of the rover‚Äôs electronics ‚Äî showing how the controller, sensors, and power circuits connect.
These PDFs are intended for quick reference during assembly, debugging, and documentation of the K.A.R.L. hardware design.

### Subsystems Included

* **Motor Control** ‚Äî Wiring between the Pico and the L298N motor driver (supports two or four TT-style motors)
* **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** ‚Äî Trigger and Echo wiring with a 5 V‚Üí3.3 V voltage divider
* **Power Distribution** ‚Äî Battery connections, logic power, and ground reference layout
* **System Overview** ‚Äî Combined schematic showing the full rover electrical topology

## ‚ö° Voltage Divider Note (HC-SR04)

Because the **HC-SR04 Echo pin outputs 5 V** and the **Raspberry Pi Pico uses 3.3 V logic**, a **resistive voltage divider** is used to protect the input pin:

```
HC-SR04 Echo ----[10 kŒ©]----+----‚Üí Pico GPx
                             |
                           [15 kŒ©]
                             |
                            GND
```

This reduces the Echo voltage to a safe ~3 V level for the Pico.

## üß∞ Design Notes

* Created entirely using **EasyEDA Online Editor**
* Exported as **PDFs** for initial documentation
* Preview images (`.png`) added for quick visualization
* Editable EasyEDA files will be included in a future update

Would you like me to make a short caption or watermark suggestion for your `full_system_overview.png` (e.g. ‚ÄúK.A.R.L. v1.0 ‚Äî EasyEDA Schematic‚Äù in the corner)? It makes the preview look polished on GitHub.
